# Accelerated-gradient-descent-algorithm
The applications of AGD in HVAC, network congestion control.
I am trying to illustrate the faster convergence rate of accelerated gradient descent algorithm 
in contrast with gradient descent. The illustrative examples include HVAC, network congestion control and x-consensus.
